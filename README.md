PokemonDatabase
===============

As a child I really enjoyed playing the Pokemon games. So when I found an API which serves as a database to all things Pokemon, I couldn't resist developing some sort of application around it! 

The API can be found here: http://pokeapi.co/

A work in progress implementation of the project can be found here: http://kiransprojects.co.uk/todo/pokemondb/

For version 2.0 of the project I decided to use local JSON files of the for the data aswell as redesigning the design of the application to look much nicer. The local JSON files were found at the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/fanzeyi/Pokemon-DB

Credit goes to fanzeyi for creating the JSON files required for this project.
