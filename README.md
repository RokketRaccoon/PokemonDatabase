PokemonDatabase
===============

As a kid I really enjoyed playing the Pokemon games. So when I found an API which serves as a database to all things Pokemon, I couldn't resist developing some sort of application around it! 

The API can be found here: http://pokeapi.co/

A work in progress implementation of the project can be found here: http://kiransprojects.co.uk/todo/pokemondb/
